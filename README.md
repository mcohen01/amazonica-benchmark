# benchmark

Quick and dirty benchmark code for measuring the performance of the [Amazonica] [1] library. 

## Usage

Run the pallet script to start an EC2 node, from which you can then use lein to run the benchmark. (Generated csv data will need to be manually copied into the html graph renderer if you want a visualization of the data.)
